# Outline 

This is a repository with the assignments of IE678 Deep Learning course at University of Mannheim. 

## 1st Assignment
- Implementation of MLP without using pre-canned PyTorch neural network functionality.
- Training & Experiments with MLPs - Backpropagation.
  - Computation of the results of the forward pass directly using basic PyTorch operations
  - Computation of the results of the backward pass directly using basic PyTorch operations (i.e. without using autograd)
